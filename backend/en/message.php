            We would love to have you participate in the Open Beta. As a beta
            tester, you’ll be able to use features that haven’t been released to
            the public. These features could become publicly available in the
            future. Consider that <b>all transactions are in test mode</b> and
            <b>will be clear</b> before the final release. Users, shops, and
            products <u>will not be removed</u>.
          </p>

          <p>Thanks,<br />CEO Selldone</p>"],
